“A Peaceman-Rachford Splitting Approach with Deep Equilibrium Network for Channel Estimation” 

We will be making all our codes publicly available soon.

# the code
The main model is in file model.py  and the file utils.py and trian.py is modified from the code "FPN-OAMP" in https://github.com/wyuaq/FPN-OAMP-THz-Channel-Estimation.

The file test_NMSE.py computes the NMSE. 

The model is trained via "python train.py"
